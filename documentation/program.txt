goal of the game 

    play hangman vs the computer
    the computer choose a word from dictionary
    the human guesses with one letter each turn
    the secret word and human letter guess 
    are compared every turn and an output is displayed

input

    one char to the command line

output 

    display the number of guess left
    display the underscore array 
    display in that array letters guessed by the user if any
    the user guess one letter but that letter can occur 
    multiple times within the secret word
    therefore all of the occurrencies will be shown.

steps 

    link the words files as dictionary

    able to pick randomly a word between 5 and 12 chars from the file and store it

    ask for input from the user and store it 

    create a display array of underscores the length of the secret word

    compare input and the secret code, find occurencies of the letter
    typed by the user in the word array of chars ['w','o','r','d']
    if user type w the program should be able to look through the hole array at once 
    and give back the index of each occurence in the array of the secret word.

    the player have 3 lives, a life is lost when the user fail to guess a letter.
    after 3 fails the user loses and the program stops.

    if the player guess all letters of the secret word he wins and the program stops

end
